# Let's Build a Website on Github

There are thousands of ways to build and publish
websites, today we're going to look at the way I
prefer to create simple concepts and information
sites, using Github Pages.

My personal website (which is incredibly out of date)
is built on Github Pages, it's a simple, free and
rewarding way to publish your work online.

## Create an Account

Github is a free network for connecting you with
developers and their code all over the world. First 
thing you'll need is in account.

Visit https://github.com/join and sign up, make
sure you choose the **free** options.

## Configure Your Profile

People will want to know who you are, so make 
sure to configure your.

* Name
* Location
* Photo

## Generate a New Website Project

Most of the information about how to use the tool
is laid out on https://pages.github.com/.

I recommend using the generator to get you started,
we'll then be editing straight in Github to see the results.

1. Create a New Repository https://github.com/new
2. Visit the settings
3. Click **Automatice Page Generator**

## Add your Site to the SUBMISSIONS.md

We're going to keep a single index of these sites
so that other students can see what you're building.

1. Edit The **SUBMISSIONS.md** file
2. Add Your Link (copy the syntax I used for mine)
3. Submit a pull request

I'll be reviewing all pull requests and either merging
or providing feedback on them.

## Personalize Your Website

Now that you've got an address on the internet it's time
to start making it your own. Github Pages uses [Jekyll] to
manage its content. Jekyll is a simple and powerful tool
for managing html information. 

Some goals to try an achieve

1. Update your homepage with your information
2. Create a blog post outlining what you did today
3. Include links to your Twitter, Instagram etc.
4. Include links to your friends github pages
